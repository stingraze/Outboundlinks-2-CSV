How to use:

Simply enter seed URL to start in seeds.txt.
Enter one URL per line.

use perl to run outboundlinks.pl . 

There will be two files that will be made,

alllinks.txt
outboundlinks.txt

alllinks.txt contains all outbound URL found starting from seeds.txt . 

outboundlinks.csv is the CSV with URL and count of how many outbound URL there is.

Enjoy.
